# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Analysis for E-Commerce

## 📌 Project Overview

The aim of this data analytics project is to perform **customer segmentation analysis** for an **e-commerce company**. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the project seeks to group customers into distinct segments. These segments help the business to:

- 🎯 Inform targeted marketing strategies  
- 😊 Improve customer satisfaction  
- 📈 Enhance overall business strategies

## 📊 Objectives

- Analyze customer transaction data
- Identify distinct customer segments using clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means)
- Interpret segment characteristics to guide business decisions

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** for clustering (K-Means, Elbow Method, etc.)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and visualization

   - Normalize numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand trends in purchase behavior
   - Visualize patterns in frequency, recency, and monetary value

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring

4. **Clustering**
   - Apply K-Means algorithm
   - Use Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine optimal number of clusters

5. **Interpretation & Visualization**
   - Profile each customer segment
   - Present insights through graphs and summary tables
